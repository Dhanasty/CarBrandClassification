# Car Brand Classification

This repository contains code and resources for a car brand classification project using ResNet50.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of cars from three brands: Mercedes, Lamborghini, and Audi. It contains a total of X images for training and Y images for testing.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture used for this project is ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network known for its excellent performance in image classification tasks. The pretrained weights of ResNet50 are utilized and fine-tuned on the car brand dataset.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or above
- TensorFlow 2.10
- Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`
